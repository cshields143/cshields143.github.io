I love words for words' sake.

I am day-by-day becoming a Minecraft app developer, because my son loves playing with them but needs help setting them up sometimes.

I excel at leveraging my full-stack web development experience into something that resembles software engineering.

While it may be a pipe dream for my lifetime, I'd like to think we're on the cusp of a practical answer to the Turing test, and I think it would be pretty cool to be a part of that journey.
